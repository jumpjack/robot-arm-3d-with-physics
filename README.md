Live demo [here](https://jumpjack.github.io/robot-arm-3d-with-physics).

You can move the grip using the mouse and see the linkage follow it. No need for inverse kinematic implementation.

Definition of the robot arm is in [robot.js](https://github.com/jumpjack/robot-arm-3d-with-physics/blob/master/robot.js)https://github.com/jumpjack/robot-arm-3d-with-physics/blob/master/robot.js.
